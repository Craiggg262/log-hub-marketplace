-- Fix security vulnerability in profiles table by restricting access to authenticated users only

-- Drop existing policies that may allow anonymous access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;

-- Create secure policies that only allow authenticated users to access their own profiles
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view their own profile" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update their own profile" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert their own profile" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Ensure no anonymous access to sensitive profile data
-- The TO authenticated clause ensures only logged-in users can access the table
-- The auth.uid() = user_id condition ensures users can only access their own data
